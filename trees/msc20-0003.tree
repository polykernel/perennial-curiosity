\p{
  A group #{G} is called \strong{commutative} (abelian) if #{g_1g_2 = g_2g_1} for all #{g_1, g_2 \in G}.
}

\p{
  \strong{Remark}: For reasons that are unbeknownst to me, in group theory we almost always say a group is abelian rather commutative, but in commutative algebra we say a ring is commutative.
