\p{
  Perennial Curiosity is an experiment to collect, distill and organize mathematics I have learned so far in a [forest of evergreen notes](https://www.jonmsterling.com/foreign-forester-tfmt-0001.xml) using the excellent [Forester](https://www.jonmsterling.com/foreign-forester-index.xml) tool by Jon Sterling. I hope that the presented material may be of use to other learners. In the future, the forest may expand to other knowledge domains.
